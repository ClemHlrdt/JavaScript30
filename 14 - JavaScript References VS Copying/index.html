    /* 
      team is a reference to players. Changing an element of the array, you will reference back to the parent array and modify its value.
    */
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // Creates a copy of players' array.
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // WRONG ! This will create a reference to person's object.
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
      number: 99
    }); // Create a new array derived from person and add the new value
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {
      ...person
    };
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
